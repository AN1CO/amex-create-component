# Scenario

We've accidentally deleted our reusable component library repository(!) but thankfully we were able to recover some unit tests from an old backup. Can you help us recreate our component?

## Instructions

You should spend no more than 2.5 hours in total on the challenge as a whole.

Each task is of equal importance, so it is better to partially complete both tasks, rather than fully complete one, leaving comments as to your intention.

We are interested in seeing your performance on the task within the given time, and will take the given time into consideration when assessing performance.

The resulting code repository should be provided back to us as a GitHub repository.

## Task One - Configuration and Documentation

Your initial task is to build a repository that we could use as a foundation for a component library. Use Technology and packages that you are comfortable with. As a quick-start we would recommend:
- Typescript
- React
- React Testing Library
- Vitest

Consider how you might handle linting, formatting, and any other Developer Experience improvements or quality of life support. Include these in the README.md as future improvements.

You are free to configure the project however you like. What is important is that you document the choices you make and why you made them.

If you run out of time to perform the actual configuration, please document what you would have done.

## Task Two - Component Build

Using the following unit test as a foundation, recreate a reusable component that would result in all of these tests passing.

Whilst the unit test was originally written with a specific testing library, if you need to refactor the functions to reflect a different package that is fine.

Consider the flexibility of this component, how you might break this down for different use cases, what configuration the end-consumer might need / want.

NOTE: However you configure the project from Task One, the expectation would be that this component can be seen rendered.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  extends: [
    // Remove ...tseslint.configs.recommended and replace with this
    ...tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked,
    // Alternatively, use this for stricter rules
    ...tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked,
    // Optionally, add this for stylistic rules
    ...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked,
  ],
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import reactX from 'eslint-plugin-react-x'
import reactDom from 'eslint-plugin-react-dom'

export default tseslint.config({
  plugins: {
    // Add the react-x and react-dom plugins
    'react-x': reactX,
    'react-dom': reactDom,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended typescript rules
    ...reactX.configs['recommended-typescript'].rules,
    ...reactDom.configs.recommended.rules,
  },
})
```
